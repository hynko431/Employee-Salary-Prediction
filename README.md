# 🚀 Employee Salary Classification Dashboard

A Streamlit-powered web app that allows users to explore and analyze employee data, predict salary classes based on demographic and work-related features, and perform both single and batch predictions using a trained machine learning model.

## 📂 Project Overview

This project provides a full-stack solution for:

* 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: View summary statistics, distributions, and missing data.
* 🧠 **Single Prediction**: Input employee details via a sidebar to predict if salary >50K or <=50K.
* 📎 **Batch Prediction**: Upload a CSV file and get predictions for multiple employees.
* 📉 **Interactive Visualizations**: View distributions and categorical breakdowns.

## 🧰 Features

* Streamlit-based interactive dashboard
* Pre-trained ML model (via `joblib`)
* Dynamic encoding of categorical variables
* Handles missing values gracefully
* Saves prediction results with the original uploaded file name

## 📁 Dataset Features

The dataset contains the following features:

* `age`
* `workclass`
* `education`
* `marital-status`
* `occupation`
* `relationship`
* `gender`
* `native-country`
* `hours-per-week`
* `experience`
* `capital-gain`
* `capital-loss`

Some values may be missing to simulate real-world scenarios.
